These institutions are often described as [[Stateless society|stateless societies]],{{sfnm|1a1=Craig|1y=2005|1p=14|2a1=Sheehan|2y=2003|2p=85}} although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].{{sfn|Suissa|2006|p=7}} Anarchism holds the [[Sovereign state|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.{{sfnm|1a1=Craig|1y=2005|1p=14|2a1=McLean|2a2=McMillan|2y=2003|2loc=Anarchism}}\\n\\nAnarchism is often considered a [[Far-left politics|far-left]]   ideology{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} and much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[Libertarian socialism|anti-authoritarian interpretations]] of [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], or [[participatory economics]].{{sfn|Guerin|1970|p=35|loc=Critique of authoritarian socialism}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many [[History of anarchism|anarchist types and traditions]] exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} [[Anarchist schools of thought]] can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].{{sfn|McLean|McMillan|2003|loc=Anarchism}} Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of [[Social anarchism|social]] and [[individualist anarchism]], or similar dual classifications.{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2009|1p=14|1loc=Anarchism|2a1=Kropotkin|2y=2002|2p=5|3a1=Fowler|3y=1972}}\\n\\n== Etymology, terminology and definition ==\\n{{see also|Anarchist terminology}}\\nThe etymological origin of anarchism derives from ancient Greek word \\'\\'anarkhia\\'\\'. \\'\\'Anarkhia\\'\\' meant \"without a ruler\" as it was composed by the prefix a  (i.e. \"without\") and the word \\'\\'arkhos\\'\\' (i.e. leader or ruler). The suffix [[-ism]] is used to denote the ideological current that favours anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} The first known use of this word was in 1642.{{sfn|Definition of Anarchism by Merriam-Webster| 2019}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled opponents as anarchists  although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early 19th century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Wilhelm Weitling]], but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}\\n\\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} the term [[libertarianism]] has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guerin|1970|loc=The Basic Ideas of Anarchism}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic free-market philosophy]] only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as libertarian anarchism.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}\\n\\nWhile [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical organisation]] (including the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], [[freedom]] and [[decentralisation]], but this definition has its own shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an \\'\\'a posteriori\\'\\' concussion).{{sfnm|1a1=Long|1y=2013|1p=217|2a1=McLaughlin|2y=2007|2pp=25–29}} Major elements of the definition of anarchism include: a) the will for a non coercive society; b) the rejection of the state apparatus; c) belief in human nature, although it is even harder to define it than anarchism; and d) a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of [[anarchy]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}\\n\\n== History ==\\n{{main|History of anarchism}}\\n\\n=== Prehistoric and ancient world ===\\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose \\'\\'[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]\\'\\' inspired 19th century anarchist philosopher [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]\\nDuring the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that hierarchy was invented and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} Most notable examples of anarchism in the ancient world were in [[History of China|China]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]], meaning peaceful delegitimising of the state, was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist philosophers]] (i.e. [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] and [[Lao Tzu]]).{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Likewise in Greece, anarchist attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict of [[autonomy|personal autonomy]] with the state rules. Socrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (\\'\\'Nomos\\'\\') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (\\'\\'physis\\'\\'). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}\\n\\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In Persia, a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian Prophet]] known as [[Mazdak]] was calling for an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian society]] and the [[abolition of monarchy]], but he soon found himself executed by the king.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}} In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Those currents were the precursor of religious anarchism in the centuries to come. It was in the [[Renaissance]] and with the spread of [[Rationalism|reasoning]] and [[humanism]] through Europe that libertarian ideas emerged. Writers were outlining in their novels ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.\\n\\n=== Classical anarchism ===\\nThe turning point towards anarchism was the [[French Revolution]] in which the anti-state and federalist sentiments began to take a form, mostly by [[Enragés]] and \\'\\'[[sans-culottes]]\\'\\'.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} Some prominent figures of anarchism begun developing the first anarchist currents.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} That is the era of classical anarchism that lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and was the golden age of anarchism. [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England morally delegitimising the state, [[Max Stirner]]\\'s thinking paved the way to individualism and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]\\'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}\\n\\n[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxism|Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the [[International Workingmen\\'s Association|First International]] before his expulsion by the Marxists]]\\n[[Michael Bakunin]] took mutualism and extended it to [[collectivist anarchism]]. Bakunin\\'s current ([[Jura Federation]]) entered the class worker union called the [[International Workingmen\\'s Association]] (IWA), later known as the First International, formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. Due to its links to active workers\\' movements, the International became a significant organisation. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon\\'s followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx\\'s [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} Bakunin\\'s followers entered a bitter dispute with Karl Marx which ended with the split of the workers movement that officially took place in the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Fifth Congress of the IWA in the Hague, 1872]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} The major reason lay in fundamentally different approaches on how the workers would emancipate themselves. Marx was advocating for the creation of a political party to take part in electoral struggles whereas Bakunin thought that the whole set of Marx\\'s thinking was very authoritarian.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=24–25}} Bakunin is famous for predicting that if such a party would gain power by Marxist\\'s terms, it would end up to be the new tyrant of workers. After being expelled from the IWA, anarchists formed the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}} The major argument of anarcho-communism was that Bakunian perspective would lead to antagonism among collectives.\\n\\nAt the turning of the century, anarchism has spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, pouring into Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|São Paulo]] was a stronghold and anarcho-syndicalism was the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During that time, a minority of anarchists embarked into utilising of violence in order to achieve their political ends. This kind of strategy is named as [[propaganda by the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves to those terrorist acts, anarchists were persecuted and were given bad fame.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} [[Illegalism]], stealing the possessions of the rich because capitalists were not their rightful owners, was another strategy some anarchist adopted during the same years.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}\\n\\n[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]\\nAnarchists took part enthusiastically in the [[Russian Revolution]]. During the revolution, anarchists had concerns, but they opted for the revolution rather than supporting the [[White movement|Whites]]. However, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilised. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious [[Bolsheviks]]. Anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow instead fled to Ukraine.{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} The [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]\\'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]] were the most notable examples. With the anarchists being crashed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. Platformists sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. The victory of the Bolsheviks in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]] did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw the Bolshevik success as setting an example and [[Communist party|communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) left the organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}\\n\\nIn the [[Spanish Civil War]], anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. Spain had a long [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist tradition]] and anarchists played an important role in the Civil War. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the Civil War, but as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seize control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists (i.e. at a series of events named [[May Days]]).{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi & 466}}\\n\\n=== Post-World War II anarchism ===\\n[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|[[Rojava]] is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative]]\\nIn the first years after World War II, the anarchist movement was severely damaged.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism. The main causes of such a revival may have been the perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and the tension build by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this era, anarchism was mostly part of other movements critical to both the state and capitalism such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Peace movement|pacifist movements]], the [[New Left]], or the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi & 539}} Anarchism was also associated with the [[punk rock]] movement as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} Although [[feminist]] tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]] in the 1960s.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}}\\n\\nAround the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the [[anti-war]], [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[Group of Eight]] (G8) and the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF).

Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. On a tactical level, [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[nihilist movement]]), with some contemporary anarchists espousing alternative direct action methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones.{{sfn|Trevijano|2001|p=57}}\\n{{clear}}\\n\\n== Topics of interest ==\\nIntersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.\\n\\n=== Anarchism and free love ===\\n{{main|Free love}}\\n{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Queer anarchism}}\\n[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]\\nAn important current within anarchism is [[free love]].{{sfn|McElroy|1996}} In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand. He proposed the concept of \\'\\'la camaraderie amoureuse\\'\\' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].{{sfn|Ronsin|2000}} In Germany, the [[Stirnerism|Stirnerists]] Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual \\'\\'[[The Joy of Sex]]\\'\\'. The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as \\'\\'Théorie du corps amoureux. Pour une érotique solaire\\'\\' (2000) and \\'\\'L\\'invention du plaisir. Fragments cyréaniques\\'\\' (2002).\\n\\n=== Anarchism and education ===\\n{{main|Anarchism and education}}\\n[[File:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Anarchism in Spain|Catalan anarchist]] pedagogue and [[Freethought|free thinker]]]]\\nEnglish anarchist William Godwin considered education an important aspect. He was against state education as he considered those schools as a way of the state to replicate privileges of the ruling class.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|p=514}} Godwin thought that education was the way to change the world. In his \\'\\'[[Political Justice]]\\'\\', he criticises state sponsored schooling and advocates for child\\'s protection from coercion.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=197}} Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called \\'\\'[[The False Principle of our Education]]\\'\\' in which Stirner was advocating for child\\'s autonomy.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1p=521|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=222}}\\n\\nIn 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer|Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established [[Ferrer movement|modern]] or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Fidler|1985|pp=103–132}} Ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both the state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils plenty of autonomy (i.e. on setting the curriculum). Ferrer was aiming to educate the working class. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later on arrested.{{sfnm|1a1=Bookchin|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=511–514}} Ferrer\\'s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] in the United States,{{sfn|Fidler|1985|pp=103–132}}\\n\\nRussian Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate.{{sfn|Hern|2010}} Tolstoy\\'s educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.{{sfn|Wilson|2001|p=xxi}} Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.{{sfn|Hern|2010}} He thought that \"[e]ducation is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself. [...] Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary\".{{sfn|Hern|2010}} For him, \"without compulsion, education was transformed into culture\".{{sfn|Hern|2010}}\\n\\nA more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.{{sfn|Purkis|2004}} Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=129}} However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.{{sfn|Suissa|2007}} In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.{{sfn|Illich|1971}}\\n\\n=== Anarchism and the state ===\\n<!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. -->\\nObjection to the state and its institutions is \\'\\'[[sine qua non]]\\'\\' of anarchism.{{sfn|Carter|1971|p=14}} Anarchists consider the government as a tool of domination and it is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless if it is [[Open government|open]] or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that some people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the argument that the state is the collective will of people as a fairy tale since the ruling class is distinct from the rest of the society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}\\n\\n[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|Which forms of violence, if any, are [[Anarchism and violence|consistent with anarchist values]] is a controversial subject among anarchists]]\\n\\n=== Anarchism and violence ===\\n{{main|Anarchism and violence}}\\nAnarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexed and controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} On one hand, anarcho-pacifists point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017}} On the other hand, other groups of anarchist are for direct action that can include sabotage or even terrorism. [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, were arguing that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]]. Peace activist and anarchist [[April Carter]] argues that violence is incompatible with anarchism because it is mostly associated with the state and authority as violence is immanent to the state. As the state\\'s capability to exercise violence is colossal nowadays, a rebellion or civil war would probably end in another authoritarian institute.{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}\\n\\n== Anarchist strategies and tactics ==\\n\\nAnarchist tactics vary considerably. A broad categorisation would be the preference of revolutionary tactics to destroy oppressive States and institutions or aiming to change society through evolutionary means. Revolutionary methods can take violent form as they did in past insurgencies (i.e., in Spain, Mexico, Russia) or during violent protests by militant protesters such as the [[black bloc]], who are generally much less violent than revolutionary movements a century ago. Anarchists also commonly employ [[direct action]], which can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchies, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2017|pp=4-5}} Often decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[Horizontalidad|horizontalism]]. Another aspect of anarchist tactics is their aim to strengthen social bonds through common actions.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109-217}}\\n\\nReclaiming public space by anarchists is another method of creating social spaces and creating squats in order to organise themselves. During important events such as protests, when spaces are being occupied, they are often called \\n\"[[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s\" (TAZ).{{sfn|Williams|2017|pp=5-6}}\\n\\n== Criticisms ==\\nMoral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilisation.\\n\\n=== Allegation of utopianism ===\\nAnarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a \"lesser evil\" than a society without \"repressive force\". He also argued that \"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\" is an \"absurdity\".{{sfn|Landauer|1959}} However, \\'\\'[[An Anarchist FAQ]]\\'\\' states the following: \"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies [as well as] some sort of \"court\" system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\".{{sfnm|1a1=The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|1y=2017|1loc=A.2.16 Does anarchism require \"perfect\" people to work?|2a1=The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|2y=2017|2loc=I.5.8 What about crime?}}\\n\\n=== Tacit authoritarianism ===\\nThe anarchist tendency known as [[platformism]] has been criticised by [[Situationist International|Situationists]],{{sfn|Debord|1993|loc=Paragraph 91}} [[Insurrectionary anarchism|insurrectionaries]], [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesis anarchists]] and others of preserving tacitly statist, authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\\n\\n=== Anarchism and civilization ===\\nIn his essay \\'\\'On Authority\\'\\', [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed that radical [[decentralization]] promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilization, citing an example of [[railway]]s:{{sfn|Engels|1978}} {{quote|Here too the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?}}\\n\\nIn the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.{{sfn|Goodwin|2014}}\\n\\n== List of anarchist societies ==\\n{{see also|List of anarchist communities}}\\n* [[Fejuve|Federation of Neighborhood Councils-El Alto]] (Fejuve; 1979–present){{sfn|Gelderloss|2010}}\\n* [[Popular Indigenous Council of Oaxaca \"Ricardo Flores Magón\"]] (CIPO-RFM; 1980s–present){{sfn|Denham|2008}}\\n* [[Landless Workers\\' Movement]] (MST; 1982–present){{sfn|Gelderloss|2010}}\\n* [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]] (MANEZ; 1994–present){{sfn|Zibechi|2012|p=132}}\\n* [[Barbacha]] (2001–present)\\n* [[Villa de Zaachila]] (2006–present)\\n* [[Cherán|Cheran]] (2011–present)\\n* [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] (Rojava; 2013–present)\\n\\n== See also ==\\n* [[:Category:Anarchism by country|Anarchism by country]]\\n* [[Governance without government]]\\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\\n* [[List of political ideologies#Anarchism|List of anarchist political ideologies]]\\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Anarchism}}\\n\\n; Foundational texts of anarchism<!-- Source: McLaughlin, 2007. -->\\n* \\'\\'[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]\\'\\' (1793) \\n* \\'\\'[[What is Property?]] (1840) \\n* \\'\\'[[The Ego and Its Own]]\\'\\' (1844)\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{reflist|refs=\\n<ref name=Capitalism>{{harvnb|Meltzer|2000|p=50}}: \"The philosophy of \"anarcho-capitalism\" dreamed up by the \"libertarian\" [[New Right]], has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.\";\\n{{harvnb|Marshall|1993|p=565}}: \"In fact, few anarchists would accept the \\'anarcho-capitalists\\' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid.
